<p>This project is a Lost and Found web application for lost items within the University of Nevada, Reno campus.  The intended user groups include UNR students, faculty, and staff, on campus student workers, building administrators, and facility services and UNR IT staff super admin.  This project aims to make the process of finding lost items on the UNR campus easier for those who find the items, those who process the items, and those who are looking for them. In addition, the goal is that this project will make it more likely for lost items to be returned to the original owner.  The public interest of this project is limited to the campus of UNR, but could be adapted to accommodate any building or campus.  

The web application presents itself like the interactive UNR map where each building is able to be selected and will take you to a separate page.  The web application will allow for super admin to manage super admin, building administrators, and student worker accounts that are allowed access to the system.  Building administrator privileges will include managing student worker account access as well.  Student worker accounts are allowed to add items, mark an item as claimed, and approve requests from public entries.  Both Building Administrators and Super Admins will also have access to these functionalities.  Anyone else who uses the application is able to submit a lost item form that will require approval before it is displayed to the public.  Everyone is also able to view found items with their descriptions and pickup locations as well as search for these items through filters.  

This project utilizes python(13.11.9 or newer), HTML, CSS, and JS as the programming languages.  PostgreSQL(17), Flask, and Angular are the necessary software.  Pip and psycopg2 are the necessary packages and libraries needed currently.  We have been utilizing Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Github Desktop, and Github for all of our development processes.  

To guarantee reliability, throughout the development of the project we will conduct thorough testing, account for error handling, ensure database consistency, and upon implementation will host the application on a reliable server or platform.  To establish security, the application will have a robust user authentication and authorization process, use data encryption, validate and sanitize user input, limit access to admin and the databases, and keep all software up to date.  To ensure safety of the application, regular backups of the database will be performed, an audit trail of user activities will be kept in the event of misuse or reference, user friendly feedback will be provided when the application encounters issues, and moderation through approval by verified accounts will keep public content under control.
