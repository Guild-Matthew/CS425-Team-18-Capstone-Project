Capstone Project for CS 425
Fall 2024 - Spring 2025

The goal of this project is to provide students at the University of Nevada, Reno with a website that will display the items in the lost and found in buildings across the campus, along with the health and safety items that are stored in each building as well. It is our goal to work with UNR to incorporate this with the UNR interactive map that students already have access to to make it simpler for users to access our project. If we are able to work with UNR facilities and the Student Health Center to help develop the website to make it as informative and useful to students as possible. If we are unable to do so, we will generate our own map and input our databases there.
